# AdventureGame

project in development in js



**1. Game Structure and Logic:**

* **Game World:**
    * Create a map of Firetop Mountain using HTML, CSS, or a game engine's built-in map functionality.
    * Divide the map into rooms or locations.
    * Each location should have its own description, images, sounds, and potential events (e.g., encounters with monsters).
* **Character Data:**
    * Define your character's stats (e.g., health, strength, agility, skills).
    * Implement a system to track inventory (items, weapons, gold).
    * Allow for customization (e.g., choosing a name, race).
* **Events and Encounters:**
    * Design different types of events:
        * **Exploration:** Discover hidden passages, solve puzzles, find items.
        * **Combat:** Fight monsters, make choices in battle, use weapons and skills.
        * **Dialogue:** Interact with NPCs, make choices that affect the story.
    * Use a mechanism (like a random number generator) to determine event outcomes.
* **Decision Points and Storytelling:**
    * Implement choices that influence the story's direction.
    * Use text boxes for dialogue and descriptions.
    * Track player choices and use them to create different storylines.

**2. Implementing AI Opponents:**

* **Simple AI with Minimax:**
    * Suitable for basic opponents like monsters in combat.
    * Minimax analyzes possible moves and chooses the one with the best outcome for the AI.
* **Machine Learning-Based AI:**
    * More complex for advanced opponents.
    * Train a TensorFlow.js or Brain.js model on game data (e.g., player moves, win conditions).
    * Use the trained model to predict AI actions.
* **AI Strategies:**
    * **Aggressive:** AI attacks frequently.
    * **Defensive:** AI prioritizes staying alive.
    * **Adaptive:** AI learns from past battles and changes its strategy based on player actions.
